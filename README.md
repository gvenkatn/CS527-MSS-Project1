# Android Ping Tool Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the Android Ping Tool Application project. This project is divided into two parts and aims to get familiar with basic Android programming concepts. Throughout this project, you will learn how to use background processes, connect to a socket, create multiple windows/activities in the application, and use buttons for navigation.

## Project Objectives

The objecrive of the project is to:

1. Implement basic Android programming.
2. Utilize background processes.
3. Connect to a socket.
4. Create multiple activities/windows in the application.
5. Use buttons for navigation throughout the application.
6. Understand and implement `activities`, `buttons`, and `TextView` in an Android application.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Basic Android Programming

- **Setup Android Studio:** Ensure you have Android Studio installed and properly set up.
- **Create a New Project:** Start a new Android project.
- **Implement Basic UI Components:**
  - Create a main activity.
  - Add `TextView` to display text.
  - Add `Button` to interact with the user.
- **Navigation Between Activities:**
  - Create multiple activities.
  - Implement navigation between these activities using buttons.

### Part 2: Advanced Features

- **Background Processes:**
  - Learn to use background threads and AsyncTask.
  - Implement a background process to handle operations like connecting to a socket.
- **Socket Connection:**
  - Understand and implement socket connections in Android.
  - Handle network operations in the background to avoid blocking the UI.
- **Ping Tool Implementation:**
  - Create a simple ping tool that connects to a server.
  - Display the results of the ping operation in the UI.
